# Creating the client website

We are going to rapidly create the client website.

This is the stage after we have created a static website with Middleman (or similar tool) to flesh out what the look and feel of the website should be. As well as the page structure and content requirements are.

We are going to create a corporate marketing style website which is based on a real product.
